I do web things and sometimes other things.

I am currently working with/on/using:
- React/Typescript (w/ Vite)
- Python (REST & WS servers, Windows/client-side(OS) services/agents)
- Go (REST & WS servers, Windows/client-side(OS) services/agents)
- C#/.NET (just dipping my toe)
- Literally any distributed database, although preferably one with an active-active architecture. I've used: CockroachDB, Cassandra, Scylla, TiDB, Riak(ish), YugabyteDB(ish), etc.
- Clustering, Cluster networking, Kubernetes & Docker Swarm, etc.
- NGINX (mostly) and Apache (not so often)
- Vultr, AWS, Azure (some GCP)

I am also running self-hosted LLMs in API servers. I have been using llama.cpp-python SDK as well as HuggingFace transformers SDK. External function calling and RAG are the driving force behind my interest.

I'm not working with the following (or as much as I'd like) but plan to in the future:
- Kubernetes
- C#/.NET
- Angular, Next.js

I do web things and sometimes other things.

I am currently working with/on/using:
- React/Typescript
- Python (REST & WS servers, Windows/client-side(OS) services/agents)
- Go (REST & WS servers, Windows/client-side(OS) services/agents)
- Literally any distributed database, although preferably one with an active-active architecture. I've used recently: CockroachDB, Cassandra, Scylla, TiDB, Riak(ish), YugabyteDB(ish), etc.
- Clustering, Cluster networking, Kubernetes & Docker Swarm, etc.
- NGINX (mostly) and Apache (not so often)
- Vultr, AWS, Azure
